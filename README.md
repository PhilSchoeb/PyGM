# PyGM
Implementation of PyGM, a graph based PPL for approximate inference - Probabilistic Graphical Models (IFT6269).

Our implementation is fully in Python and made from scratch. However, it is not yet complete. There is still some debugging to do and some features to add. We wrote a full report about this project that can be found [here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/pfvdjhmtnwbm#fd3a65).
